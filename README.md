# todo_provider

A new Flutter project after [Sangwook's Udemy Provider course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-provider-essential-korean/)

## Getting Started

This repository has four branches, starting from main, ramified to each types of provider.
- CNP+CNPP used ChangeNotifierProvider with ChangeNotifierProxyProvider
- CNP+PP used ChangeNotifierProvider with ProxyProvider
- todo_provider_state used StateNotifierProvider

You will see what I mean in each main.dart file.
